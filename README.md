# CHECK FUNTISON WITH THERI CODE
# ENROLL IN GITCLASSROOM
# TRY THE COMPETITION
# LATEX REPORT
# WRITE READ ME
PARSER FOR THE INPUT FOLDER WTH DATA (PUT ALSO IN THE DOCUMENTATION)

# PLOTS (sofiia)
- PUT THE ROC CRUVE PLOT
- CORRELATION VAR
- hist  (before inputing, after imputing and withou nan_class)
- SCATTERPLOTS for continuops
- other ideas
- class invarince

# ATTENTION
ATTEMTION IN OGISTC REGRESSOON LABELS MUST BE (0.1)

# QUESTIONS FOR TAs
- how to solve class imbalance, cut some data?
    - If your dataset contains many more negative samples than positive ones, a model that always predicts the positive class could achieve a high F1 score (for the positive class) while having low accuracy, because it's misclassifying most of the negative samples.
- what put in the final report, the crossvalidation metrics on x_train, or the results of the challenge
- can we roemeve rows from the daatset
- does the run.py shoduld run only the best run that we have created or give the possibilty fo runnign everything we have done??
- the graphs/plots shoduld be created from the run file? also the oen of EDA?
