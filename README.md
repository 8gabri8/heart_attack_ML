# Idea

## Preprocessing
- normalize
- filter feature that are not Nan for at least N% of the observation
- impute NaN values
- PCA

# Train
- differt inital guesses of w
- differt gamma for GD
- use differnt optimizer Adam, momentum ...
- use other losses

# Plots
- how the loss decrease in GD over the iterations
